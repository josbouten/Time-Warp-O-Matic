# Time-Warp-O-Matic

Time-Warp-O-Matic is a PT2399 based delay/echo/chorus multi effect built using 2 prefabricated PT2399 boards, a CD4066 analog switch, a rotary encoder, 2 potmeters and 2 opamps.
The analog switch allows for choosing in which way the signals are routed to and from the PT2399s and the output. Furthermore a feedback / tail and a Wet/Dry control are included.
An arduino nano, a rotary control and an OLED display allow for setting effect parameters. The PT2399 configuration / signal routing can be chosen using the rotary encoder. 
Finally a foot pedal input was added and a CV-input.
